#  Check Username availability across 50+ websites instantly

Very often while registering to new websites we try to keep the same username across all the websites. Sometimes the username is available and sometimes itâ€™s not. :(

I created a simple tool using which you can instantly find out if your favorite username is available or not on over 50+ websites.

## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unique-username) to install username.

```bash
npm i unique-username -g      //-g to install the project globally
```

## Usage
Check the availability of a particular username
```bash
username u <your_username>
```

Help
```bash
username u --help
```

## Contributing
Please raise an issue if you feel something is wrong or a potential bug.
Please raise PR with any changes or additional features that you may like to add.

You must have the below dependencies before you start working on it.

    Node.js
    npm

Once you've met the dependencies, cd to the project folder and execute this command to run the project with node.

```bash
node index.js u <your_username>
```
