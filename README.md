#  Check Username availability across 140+ websites instantly

Very often while registering to new websites we try to keep the same username across all the websites. Sometimes the username is available and sometimes itâ€™s not. :(

I created a simple tool using which you can instantly find out if your favorite username is available or not on over 140+ websites.

## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unique-username) to install username.

```bash
npm i unique-username -g      //-g to install the project globally
```

## Usage
Check the availability of a particular username across all 140+ websites.
```bash
username u <your_username>
```

Check the availability of a particular username on a particular website.
```bash
username d <serviceName> <your_username>
```

Get the list of all supported services
```bash
username services
```

Help
```bash
username u --help
```
